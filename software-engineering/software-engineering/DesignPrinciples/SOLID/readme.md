# SOLID Design Principles

**SOLID** is a set of five design principles that help you write better code. These principles act as guidelines to keep your code clean, organized, and easy to understand—similar to how organizing your toys makes it easier to find and play with them.

## Summary of SOLID Principles

1. **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**:  
   Each class should have one job or responsibility.

2. **OCP (Open/Closed Principle)**:  
   Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. **LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)**:  
   Subclasses should be able to replace their parent classes without affecting the functionality.

4. **ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)**:  
   Clients should only be required to depend on methods they use, not on methods they don't need.

5. **DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)**:  
   Depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.

These principles are essential for keeping your codebase organized, easy to understand, and simple to modify or extend over time.
